            <h3>Learning how to create a website</h3>
            <p>
                Any website you create begins with a clear website goal and target audience. By identifying your niche
                and
                purpose, you can take steps towards building a site that not only looks pretty but performs as you hope
                it
                will.


                Everything from your site layout to content should ladder up to your intended impact. For example, a
                portfolio
                website will naturally look different from an online store. A portfolio will include pages showcasing
                your
                work
                and a prominent “Contact Me” form—whereas an online store will have product pages, payment pages and
                maybe
                even
                print-on-demand integrations that are intended to monetize your website.

            <h2>Become a web developer</h2>
            <p>
                While it's not the easiest subject to pick up on your own, it's very achievable to learn with the help
                of mentors from a coding bootcamp or college setting. The basic building blocks of web design are HTML
                (Hyper Text Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets).
            </p>
            <p>Is HTML a good skill to learn?
                Learning HTML can provide tremendous value to people working in tech, as well as to those who are
                running their own business or managing a website. Even if you just want to create an online portfolio
                for your work, HTML can be a fantastic skill to have in your repertoire.</p>

                <p>An aspiring web developer must first complete an education to develop basic coding and programming
                    skills. In most cases, this is a computer science degree program with core courses in systems
                    design,
                    data management, and the essential programming languages used by industry professionals.</p>

                <p>Web developers design, maintain, and optimize websites and other web-based applications for consumer
                    use.
                    They rely on insights from computer programming, software development, and graphic design, often
                    working
                    alongside professionals in each field.

                    Most web developers specialize in several aspects of the development process. Duties, tools, and
                    techniques vary depending on the position. The following information provides insight into some
                    common
                    web developer roles.</p>
