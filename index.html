            <h3>Learning how to create a website</h3>
            <p>
                Any website you create begins with a clear website goal and target audience. By identifying your niche
                and
                purpose, you can take steps towards building a site that not only looks pretty but performs as you hope
                it
                will.


                Everything from your site layout to content should ladder up to your intended impact. For example, a
                portfolio
                website will naturally look different from an online store. A portfolio will include pages showcasing
                your
                work
                and a prominent “Contact Me” form—whereas an online store will have product pages, payment pages and
                maybe
                even
                print-on-demand integrations that are intended to monetize your website.

            <h2>Become a web developer</h2>
            <p>
                While it's not the easiest subject to pick up on your own, it's very achievable to learn with the help
                of mentors from a coding bootcamp or college setting. The basic building blocks of web design are HTML
                (Hyper Text Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets).
            </p>
            <p>Is HTML a good skill to learn?
                Learning HTML can provide tremendous value to people working in tech, as well as to those who are
                running their own business or managing a website. Even if you just want to create an online portfolio
                for your work, HTML can be a fantastic skill to have in your repertoire.</p>
